# MSTU 5003 Final Project - Summer A 2018

Our final project contains a 5-page website focused on "summer reading".  On the homepage, a user will find links to three separate "book review" pages, and then a final link to a "create your own book review" page.  In the second half of the homepage, the user will answer several questions about books. The information will be used to create a personalized bookmark based on the responses that were input.  The three "book review" pages include a summary, an embedded video, and an opportunity for the user to provide feedback about the book.  On the final "create your own book review" page, a user can change the title of the page to reflect the book they are reviewing, along with changing the image and embedded videos that appear on the page.  Finally, the user will input their own summary.
